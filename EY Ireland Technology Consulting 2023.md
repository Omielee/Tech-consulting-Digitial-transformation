# SUMMARY
This brochure outlines EY's technology consulting services, giving me a thorough grasp of what the tech consulting team works, what services each branch provides, and what services each team previously provided. I summarised some of the services' key points.
Technology delivery, SAP services, and intelligent automation are three areas of interest to me, and I am eager to explore these career pathways.
